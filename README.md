# Pasur Trainer

This project involves adding scoring and logging features to an existing Pasur card game trainer. Pasur is a card game played with a standard 52-card deck, involving 2-4 players, with the objective of winning the most points.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following components:

Pasur: Contains the source code for the project.
P2Validation: Contains test files for testing the functionality of the project.
Understanding of Project 2 Spec: The understanding and information in the project.


## Game Rules

The game of Pasur involves dealing four cards to each player and placing four face-up cards in the middle of the table as the pool. Players take turns playing one card to the pool, either by adding it to the pool or using it to pick up one or more cards from the pool. A player cannot add a card to the pool if that card can pick up one or more cards from the pool. The game continues until each player has no cards remaining in their hands.

## Scoring and Logging
The project involves adding scoring and logging features to the existing Pasur Trainer. The implementation should be flexible, allowing for future maintenance and modification by the NERD team. The scoring should be based on the rules of the Pasur game, and the logging should track the sessions of the game, including scores for each player.

## Programming language
Java

## Conclusion
This project involves adding scoring and logging features to an existing Pasur card game trainer, with a flexible design that allows for future maintenance and modification. The game of Pasur involves dealing cards, playing cards to the pool, and picking up cards from the pool, with the objective of winning the most points. The project also includes documentation and test files for testing the functionality of the trainer.
